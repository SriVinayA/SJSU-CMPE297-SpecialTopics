# Documentation Writing with Claude Dev Extension

This directory demonstrates how the Claude Dev Extension can assist with writing comprehensive documentation for code.

## Use Case

Generating detailed documentation for a Python class that represents a bank account.

## Example

Consider the following Python class for a bank account:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, owner_name, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.owner_name = owner_name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            return True
        return False

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def transfer(self, other_account, amount):
        if self.withdraw(amount):
            other_account.deposit(amount)
            return True
        return False
```

## How Claude Dev Extension Helps

1. Analyze the class structure, methods, and their purposes.
2. Generate comprehensive docstrings for the class and its methods.
3. Provide a high-level description of the class's functionality.
4. Include parameter descriptions, return values, and possible exceptions.
5. Add usage examples to illustrate how to use the class and its methods.

Here's how the Claude Dev Extension might generate documentation for this class:

```python
class BankAccount:
    """
    A class representing a bank account.

    This class provides basic functionalities of a bank account such as
    deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transfer between accounts.

    Attributes:
        account_number (str): The unique identifier for the account.
        owner_name (str): The name of the account owner.
        balance (float): The current balance of the account. Defaults to 0.

    Example:
        >>> account1 = BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe", 1000)
        >>> account2 = BankAccount("0987654321", "Jane Smith", 500)
        >>> account1.deposit(500)
        True
        >>> account1.get_balance()
        1500
        >>> account1.transfer(account2, 200)
        True
        >>> account1.get_balance()
        1300
        >>> account2.get_balance()
        700
    """

    def __init__(self, account_number, owner_name, balance=0):
        """
        Initialize a new BankAccount instance.

        Args:
            account_number (str): The unique identifier for the account.
            owner_name (str): The name of the account owner.
            balance (float, optional): The initial balance of the account. Defaults to 0.
        """
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.owner_name = owner_name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """
        Deposit money into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the deposit was successful, False otherwise.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the amount is not a positive number.

        Example:
            >>> account = BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe")
            >>> account.deposit(100)
            True

            100
        """
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """
        Withdraw money from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the withdrawal was successful, False otherwise.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the amount is not a positive number or exceeds the current balance.

        Example:

    def get_balance(self):
        """
        Get the current balance of the account.

        Returns:
            float: The current balance of the account.

        """
        return self.balance

    def transfer(self, other_account, amount):
        """
        Transfer money from this account to another account.

        Args:
            other_account (BankAccount): The recipient account.
            amount (float): The amount to transfer.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the transfer was successful, False otherwise.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the amount is not a positive number or exceeds the current balance.

        Example:
            >>> account1 = BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe", 1000)

            True
            >>> account1.get_balance()
            700
            >>> account2.get_balance()

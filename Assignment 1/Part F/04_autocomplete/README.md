# Autocomplete with Claude Dev Extension

This directory demonstrates how the Claude Dev Extension can assist with code autocomplete and suggestions.

## Use Case

Autocompleting and suggesting appropriate methods and properties while working with a complex API or library.

## Example

Let's consider a scenario where a developer is working with the Python Requests library to make HTTP requests and process the responses.

## How Claude Dev Extension Helps

1. Recognize the context and the library being used (Requests in this case).
2. Provide intelligent autocomplete suggestions for methods, parameters, and properties.
3. Offer inline documentation and type hints.
4. Suggest common patterns and best practices.

Here's an example of how the Claude Dev Extension can assist with autocomplete:

```python
import requests

# As the developer types 'response = requests.', the extension suggests:
# - get()
# - post()
# - put()
# - delete()
# - head()
# - options()
# ...

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# As the developer types 'response.', the extension suggests:
# - status_code
# - headers
# - text
# - json()
# - content
# - raise_for_status()
# ...

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    
    # As the developer works with 'data', the extension provides context-aware suggestions
    # based on the typical structure of JSON responses
    
    for item in data['items']:
        print(item['name'])
        
    # The extension may also suggest error handling:
    # try:
    #     for item in data['items']:
    #         print(item['name'])
    # except KeyError as e:
    #     print(f"Key not found: {e}")

else:
    response.raise_for_status()

# When working with error handling, the extension suggests:
# - requests.exceptions.HTTPError
# - requests.exceptions.ConnectionError
# - requests.exceptions.Timeout
# ...

try:
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Benefits

- Increased productivity: Developers can write code faster with intelligent autocomplete suggestions.
- Reduced errors: Autocomplete helps prevent typos and suggests correct method names and parameters.
- Learning aid: Inline documentation and suggestions help developers learn new libraries and APIs more quickly.
- Best practices: The extension can suggest common patterns and best practices for using the library.
- Context-aware suggestions: Autocomplete adapts to the current context, providing relevant suggestions based on the code structure and data types.

By using the Claude Dev Extension for autocomplete, developers can write more accurate code more quickly, especially when working with complex libraries or APIs they may not be entirely familiar with. This feature significantly reduces the need to constantly refer to documentation, allowing for a more fluid and efficient coding experience.

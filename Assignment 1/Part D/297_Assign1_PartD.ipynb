As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.[1]\n",
        "\n",
        "The largest and most capable LLMs, as of August 2024, are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, which enables efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or can be guided by prompt engineering.[2] These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[3] inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.[4]\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notable LLMs are OpenAI's GPT series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o; used in ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), Google's Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta's LLaMA family of models, IBM's Granite models initially released with Watsonx, Anthropic's Claude models, and Mistral AI's models.\n",
        "\n",
        "History\n",
        "Before 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved then-SOTA perplexity.[5] In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"[6]), upon which they trained statistical language models.[7][8] In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.[9]\n",
        "\n",
        "After neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. As it was before Transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "An illustration of main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention\n",
        "At the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 Seq2seq technology,[10] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[11] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\".[12] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.[13] GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz.[14] The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities.[15] OpenAI did not reveal high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4.\n",
        "\n",
        "Competing language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.[16]\n",
        "\n",
        "Since 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. As of June 2024, The Instruction fine tuned variant of the Llama 3 70 billion parameter model is the most powerful open LLM according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, being more powerful than GPT-3.5 but not as powerful as GPT-4.[17]\n",

        "As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the Transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[18][19][20] ...\"\"\"\n",

            "* **Privacy Concerns:** LLMs may be used to analyze personal data, raising privacy concerns.\n",

(2007) Summary: This influential paper discusses how climate change impacts coral reefs through various mechanisms, including ocean warming, acidification, and increased frequency of severe weather events. The authors highlight the following key points: Coral Bleaching: Elevated sea temperatures lead to coral bleaching, where corals expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae, resulting in a loss of color and essential nutrients. Prolonged bleaching can lead to coral death and reduced reef structure. Ocean Acidification: Increased CO2 levels reduce the availability of calcium carbonate, which corals use to build their skeletons. This acidification impairs coral growth and the ability to maintain reef structures. Extreme Weather Events: More frequent and intense storms cause physical damage to reefs, exacerbate sedimentation, and impact coral health ...\", \"... The Effects of Climate Change on Coral Reef Ecosystems by Bellwood et al. (2004) Summary: This paper explores the broader ecological consequences of climate change on coral reefs, focusing on shifts in species composition and ecosystem dynamics. Key findings include: Changes in Biodiversity: Climate change can alter species distributions and interactions within coral reef ecosystems. For example, warming waters might favor certain algal species over corals, leading to shifts in reef community structure. Ecosystem Services: Coral reefs provide essential services such as fish habitat, coastal protection, and tourism opportunities. Climate-induced degradation can diminish these services, impacting human communities that depend on reefs for their livelihoods. Resilience and Adaptation: The study discusses the potential for some coral species and ecosystems to adapt to changing conditions. However, the capacity for resilience is often limited, and effective management strategies are necessary to support adaptation and recovery. ...\", ...]\n",

            "**What the code does:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **`calculate_average(numbers)` function:**\n",
            "   - Takes a list of numbers (`numbers`) as input.\n",
            "   - Calculates the `total` sum of all elements in the list using `sum(numbers)`.\n",
            "   - Calculates the average by dividing the `total` by the number of elements in the list (`len(numbers)`).\n",
            "   - Returns the calculated average.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **`my_list = [10, 20, \"30\", 40]`:**\n",
            "   - Defines a list named `my_list`. It contains integers (10, 20, 40) and a string (\"30\").\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **`average = calculate_average(my_list)`:**\n",

            "   - Prints the calculated average to the console.\n",

            "**The Error:**\n",

            "**Solution:**\n",
            "\n",
            "To fix this, you need to ensure that all elements in your list are numbers before passing them to the `calculate_average` function. You can achieve this by converting the string \"30\" to an integer using `int()`:\n",

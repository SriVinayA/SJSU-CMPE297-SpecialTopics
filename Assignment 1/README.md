# Teachable Machine Models Assignment

This repository contains three models developed using Teachable Machines: an image model, a pose model, and an audio model. These models were created as part of an educational assignment to demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning in recognizing images, poses, and audio signals.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories, each corresponding to a different type of model:

- **Image Model**: Contains the trained model for image recognition tasks.
- **Pose Model**: Houses the model trained to recognize human poses.
- **Audio Model**: Includes the trained model for audio recognition.

Each directory contains the following:

- `image.png`: A screenshot of the trained model in Teachable Machines.
- `.zip` file: The exported model is ready for use in projects. The name of the zip file corresponds to the type of model it contains.

## How to Use

To use these models in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Choose the model you wish to use (image, pose, or audio).
2. Download the corresponding `.zip` file from the respective directory.
3. Unzip the file in your project directory.
4. Follow the integration instructions provided by Teachable Machines for deploying the model in your application.

## Models Overview

### Image Model
- **File**: `tm-my-image-model.zip`
- This model is trained to recognize various images based on the dataset provided during the training phase.

### Pose Model
- **File**: `my-pose-model.zip`
- The pose model can identify specific human poses, making it suitable for applications that require gesture or action recognition.
